/*
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
*/

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
  //create hash
  //loop through array,
    //set each index to key
  //loop again
    //set difference to target - arr[i]
  //check hash to see if diff is a prop && if hash[diff] doesnt equal i
    //return [i, hash[diff]]
};
